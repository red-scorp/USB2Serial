# USB2Serial project

USB to Serial board came as a helping board for my another my project.
I had to program a number of cheap Arduino Pro Mini clone boards in a row.
The problem I was having was to mix up cable all the time.
I decided to fix this issue once and for all by creating a simple USB to Serial interface board which will connect directly with Arduino Pro Mini correctly.

## USB2Serial_CH340G_v1.0

**USB2Serial_CH340G_v1.0** is a simple USB to Serial board based on CH340G chip, created especially to fit well with Arduino Pro Mini boards.

[Schematics in PDF format](USB2Serial_CH340G_v1.0.pdf)

Features:

- based on cheap CH340G chip
- configurable for 5V and 3.3V

CAM files are available.
BOM and PnP files are available.

## USB2Serial_CH340G_v1.1

**USB2Serial_CH340G_v1.1** is an advancement of v1.0 design.
The only difference here is a row of locked holes to allow to use it without soldering female header on the board.
