# USB2Serial project

USB to Serial board came as a helping board for my another my project.
I had to program a number of cheap Arduino Pro Mini clone boards in a row.
The problem I was having was to mix up cable all the time.
I decided to fix this issue once and for all by creating a simple USB to Serial interface board which will connect directly with Arduino Pro Mini correctly.

## USB2Serial_CH340G_v1.2

**USB2Serial_CH340G_v1.2** is a simple USB to Serial board based on CH340G chip, created especially to fit well with Arduino Pro Mini boards.
